# Functions 
aka procedures, methods, or subroutines
What is it? a black box with 0 or more inputs and 1 output. 
Why have it? 
- organization 
- simplification (easier to debug)
- reusablity 

Function Declarations go at the top of the code before main() to give the compiler a heads up 
syntax: return-type name(arguments);
